# Torrents-Analysis-Team-Foxtrot
PDF REPORT ON THE TORRENTS ANALYSIS FOR TEAM FOXTROT

GROUP NAME: Team Foxtrot
PROJECT TITLE: Torrent Analysis
Team Foxtrot was provided with an SQLite DB file to analyze and extract some
information therein. The SQLite DB contained a dataset on a What.CD API which had
information on the entire torrents tagged hip hop with about 75,719 releases as at 22nd
October, 2016.
Team Foxtrot were given the task of answering the following questions:
1. What is the most popular release type?
2. For the last three years, what release type had the most torrents?
3. Who are the top five most common artists?
4. Average number of downloads.
We downloaded the DB bowser for SQLite to enable us view the database file. Following
this we ran queries to answer the questions posed above. Below are the answers to the
questions with the different queries we ran to arrive at that conclusion.
1. The most popular release type among the 15 different release types is Unknown.
This result was gotten when we ran the query: SELECT MAX(releaseType) FROM
torrents;
2. The release type that had the most torrents was Album with 8,852 torrents.
Running the query below provided us the required infoemation for question 2.
SELECT groupYear, releaseType,
COUNT(*)
FROM torrents
WHERE groupYear BETWEEN 2013 and 2016
GROUP BY groupYear
ORDER BY COUNT(*)
DESC
LIMIT 1;
3. The top five most common artists as deduced from running the query:
SELECT artist, COUNT(artist) AS COUNT
FROM torrents
GROUP BY artist
ORDER BY count

DESC
LIMIT 5; are
1) Various artists [6,381]
2) DJ Screw [353]
3) Eminem [132]
4) 2 Pac [127]
5) Lilâ€™ Wayne [120]
4. The average number of downloads was approximately 207. This endpoint was
achieved when the query below was run.
SELECT AVG(totalSnatched) FROM torrents;
